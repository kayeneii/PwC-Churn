## Customer Demography and Churn Metrics for PhoneNow 

### Overview
---
This project was built to analyze and report on the churn data of PhoneNow, a telecommunications company concerned about its customer retention rates. The major goal was to identify key metrics and trends that help understand customer demography, track account information, and identify key trends in subscription services. Additionally, the findings of the data was visually communicated in a manner that best informed the Retentions Manager at PhoneNow.


### Dataset
---
The dataset used in generating this report was the Churn Dataset.xlsx provided by the _PricewaterhouseCooper_ (PwC) Power BI Internship Program. For more info, see [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-experience/a87GpgE6tiku7q3gu/pw-c-switzerland/power-bi-cqxg/introduction).

### Methods
---
The following tools were used in the creation of this report.
1. **Microsoft Excel:** For data cleaning and preparation, initial exploration, and visualization.
  * Data Cleaning and Preparation:
    - Data loading and inspection
    -  Data cleaning
       
2. **Microsoft Power BI:** For,
  * Further Data Processing:
    - Data loading and quality inspection
    -  Data transformation and formatting

  * Data Analysis: During the analysis, the following conditional columns were created in the Power Query:

 ```DAX 
	= If Contract equals Two year Then 2
	Else if Contract equals One year Then 1
	Else 0
```
	
   = **Loyalty**
	
```DAX 
	= If tenure is less than 12 Then <1 Year

### Findings and Recommendations
---
1. **Findings:** Following the conclusive analysis of the Churn Dataset, the following findings were made:
    * The percentage of customers that signed up for: 
          - Phone Services was 90.90%
          - Multiple Lines was 50.03%
          - Internet Services was  93.95%
          - Online Security was 15.78%
          - Online Backup was 27.98%
          - Device Protection was 34.39%
          - Tech Support was 16.59%
          - Streaming TV was 43.55%
          - Streaming Movies was 43.77%
    * 7% of the customers have been subscribed for less than 6 years, 15% for less than 5 years, 20% for less than 4 years, 22% for less than 3 years, 30% for less than 2 years, and 48% for less than a year.
    * 3.88K are monthly contractors, while 1.7K two-year contractors and 1.47K are yearly contractors.
    * More customers pay via 'Electronic Check'.
    * 4,171 customers use paperless billing. 
    * The overall monthly charge is 456.12K
    * Total annual charge is 16 Million.
    * Total number of tickets opened in:
         - Administrative is 3,632
         - Technical is 2,955
    * 49.5% of customers are female customers while 50.5% are male.
    * Of the total 7,043 customers, 16.21% are Senior Citizens.
    * 17.44% have dependents.
    * 35.79% have partners.

2. **Recommendations:**
   - Make subscription services more accessible and inclusive for the senior citizens.
   - Create a marketing and sales strategy that improves subscription rate to at least 60% across all services. Only Phone and Internet Services seem to have excellent rates.
   - Take customer survey on customer satisfaction with services provided and suggestions for improvement.
   - Conduct a deep research to discover why customer subscription drops after the first year period. This might have to do with the 'free-trial' offered.
   - Ensure seamless electronic billing services as the more customers prefer paperless billing.
